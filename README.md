# Architecture of Big Data Systems
###Big Data and Data Analytics, Second Semester, Master of Engineering  
Session and Duration: Spring 2017, January-April  
Instructor: M. Devi Prasad


## Purpose and Course Objectives  
We will take up the exercise of identifying and elaborating the big data processing requirements in Manipal. In addition, we will identify some of the challenges of big data processing in the context of Manipal Healthcare systems. We will learn that there are too many challenges in data collection, data integration, enforcing privacy and security, and in provisioning data science services to researchers, business partners, and other interested parties.

Drawing from a reasonably deeper understanding, we shall propose Manipal Data Architecture (MDA) for enabling and supporting data science activities in the areas of interest for Manipal University.

We shall try to identify technical experiments, investigations, and research required to engineer a software architecture. We shall keep visiting the proposed architecture to fill in more details in the due course.

As a part of the exercise, we shall build many small systems in a bottom up approach. The goal is to lift a few things off the blueprint into more technological realm. This requires us to put many technological pieces together so as to get a feel of the overall complexity of the entire system.


## Plan of Action  
We will review a few published case studies of big data systems architectures. The idea is to gain a broad understanding of the architectural and technological decisions that influence the performance of these systems. We believe 	that by reflecting upon these works, we will gain insights that will help us in building Manipal Data Architecture.

We will use state of the art technologies for virtualization, data integration, batch processing, stream processing, analysis and visualization. We will build small components and experiment with many ideas.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of the course, the student should be able to
 1. design layered software architectures for big data processing.
 2. develop solutions that combine batch-processing with streaming techniques.
 3. learn to use Apache technology suite: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and related frameworks.
 4. develop a few data analytics and visualization services within the proposed architecture of MDA.
