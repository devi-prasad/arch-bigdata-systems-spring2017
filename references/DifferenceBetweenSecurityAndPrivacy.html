<h1>Title: The Difference Between Security and Privacy </h1>

<p>A certain confusion exists in the industry about security and privacy. 
Some people equate security for privacy, while others think privacy is
something that will only interest  "those with something to hide".   Security
is a necessary tool to build privacy, but a communication or transaction
environment can be very secure, yet totally unprivate.  Privacy is a basic
human right and is recognized as a necessity by the European Union (Privacy
Directive) and the OECD (Principles of Fair Information Practice).  Finally,
privacy is simply good business, and will be required for M-Commerce to gain
widespread adoption by consumers around the world.    </p>

<p>Security and privacy are closely related technologies, however, there are
important differences that need to be understood in order to design new
systems that address both.  Privacy is about informational
self-determination--the ability to decide what information about you goes
where.  Security offers the ability to be confident that those decisions are
respected. For example, we talk about GSM voice privacy--can someone listen to
my call?  There is a privacy goal, which is to allow me to say no, and a
security technology, encryption, that allows me to enforce it. In this
example, the goals of security and privacy are the same.  But there are other
times when they may be orthogonal, and there are also times when they are in
conflict.  </p>

<p>There is a security goal of authenticating a handset.  In some instances
this may be done by RF fingerprinting, which is not a privacy issue-we
securely authenticate that the handset is the one that is linked to an
account, thus ensuring that the right person is billed.  Here, security and
privacy are orthogonal.  </p>

<p>Caller presentation is an example of a place where security and privacy can
conflict.  I may want privacy, in not letting anyone else see my number, while
the callee may want the security of thinking they know who is calling.  In
this situation, in most countries, a balance has been struck in favour of
informational self-determination, allowing the caller to choose if caller
information is available.  </p>

<p>In the area of location information, allowing disclosure of location
information out on an continuous basis creates a number of privacy issues, but
occasionally, when calling for emergency services, it is useful to reveal.  It
is important to design these system so that the phone's owner is in control
and happy, and to ensure that the security measures in place support the
owner's decision effectively.   </p>

<p>SSL is often confused with privacy.  SSL offers "privacy" against
eavesdroppers, but this is better called confidentiality.  The well-publicized
break-ins at CDNow and other retailers using SSL show that privacy requires
more than SSL.  (The same issues apply to WTLS, although WTLS also creates a
problem with the decryption at the WTLS gateway, and a question of is that
trustworthy?)  It requires minimizing the amount of information that is
transmitted and stored.  </p>

<p>So, in handling payments, one can achieve strong security by sending around
the electronic equivalents of cheques, which are cleared, online.  The cheque
is signed, the bank is asked if there is enough money, and everything flows
smoothly.  Excellent privacy with the same security can be obtained with using
modern e-cash systems.  E-cash with online verification allows the money to be
spent without revealing the account number.  Since the account number is never
given to the merchant, privacy is strongly preserved, even when there is a
security lapse. Private Credentials can enable a totally secure AND private
environment for mobile payment and signatures.   </p>

<p>Whether it is for payment, signature or location-based services, Privacy
protection technologies must be an integral part of future mobile
infrastructure in order for new mobile services to be adopted by consumers.
